December 19, 2021 

Iâ€™m serving as a **shadow on the Enhancements team** for the current **Kubernetes 1.23 release**.

Most of the work for Enhancements team, i.e shepherding features for the current Kubernetes release cycle and maintaining the status of [Kubernetes Enhancements Proposals or KEP(s)](https://github.com/kubernetes/enhancements/blob/master/keps/README.md), happens right at the beginning of the release.
