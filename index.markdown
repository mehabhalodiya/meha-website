## [Update: Kubernetes 1.24 Release Docs Shadow]( /_posts/2022-01-08-update.md)

January 08, 2022

ðŸ‘‹ **_A very quick update!_**

I got selected as a Kubernetes 1.24 Release Docs Shadow. This is my second time as a Kubernetes Release Docs Shadow and I plan to keep doing it until I get it right with various SIG!

As of today, weâ€™re already 3 weeks into the current release cycle. Please consider going through the [Release Timeline](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/) for more.
