üìù **_A very quick update!_**

I got selected as a Kubernetes 1.24 Release Docs Shadow. This is my second time as a Kubernetes Release Docs Shadow and I plan to keep doing it until I get it right with various SIG!

As of today, we‚Äôre already 3 weeks into the current release cycle. Please consider going through the [Release Timeline](https://www.kubernetes.dev/resources/release/) for more.

If you want to read what all Enhancements KEP(s) are being tracked under the Kubernetes 1.24 release, please check the current Enhancements tracking sheet: [docs.google.com/spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T21mUTvPh70NB2eseHjCyD4LgRjyxWI9Bd1SoP8zAwA/edit#gid=0)

To folks who‚Äôre interested in learning how Kubernetes releases happens and what goes on behind all the hard work, please consider reading the Release Team [Role Handbooks](https://github.com/kubernetes/sig-release/tree/master/release-team/role-handbooks).

I will update more on this...
