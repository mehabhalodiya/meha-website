<sub>I'm mostly an open-source enthusiast and a keen learner. Previously, was part of Kubernetes 1.23 Release Team as a Docs Shadow.</sub>

<sub>I like to talk about ~ *Kubernetes, Containers, Python, Golang, Open Source, and more ...* And I'm ***very*** keen to learn about ~ *everything DevOps: Networking & Security, CI/CD, Cloud Providers, Monitoring,...*.</sub>

<sub>This blog is a running record of all things about me, & nothing specific in general. ðŸ™‚ 

<sub>I talk about ***what things I'm learning currently***, and sometimes (which is really *sometimes* only), I try to make ***beautiful book notes***.</sub>

<sub>You could find me at these other places, as well:</sub>
